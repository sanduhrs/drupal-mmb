Mobile Media Blog depends on the two modules upload[1] and mailhandler[2]
You may read the documentation [5][6][7] related to those modules on how to set them up.

Mobile Media Blog does nothing more/less, than parsing e-mails provided through mailhandler for files and attaching those files to a node via upload.module.

It handles all kinds of files which are allowed by upload settings.
Files are displayed as attachments per default, you may change this by altering upload settings.
You may display images automatically inline through inline.module[3], which sadly doesn't support other fileformats by now [4].
